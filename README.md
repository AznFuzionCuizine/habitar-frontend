<!-- Habitar
Habitar is a habit tracking app for parents to track their child(ren)’s habit streaks.

Motivation
Our team at Fuzion wanted to create an app that combines our passion for social impact and our love of gaming. After many brainstorming sessions and app iterations, we created Habitar.
Habitar is an app parents can use to interact with their child(ren) and promote good habits for their children through a fun medium and a visual representation of their habit streaks.
We believe our app can positively impact parent-child relationships and “hatch good habits” for many children around world, one Habitar at a time.

How to use?
Instructions:
 1) Register
•	Click the register button in the home page (or in our navigation bar) and fill out the form to register
  2. Create a new habit
•	Child's name - enter the child's name
•	Habit - enter a name for the habit your want to work on with the child
•	Describe Habit - (optional) enter a description of the habit you are working on if needed
•	1-week reward - enter the reward you want to give the child after doing the habit for 7 days
•	3-week reward - enter the reward you want to give the child after doing the reward for 21 days (3 weeks). The child obtains 1 streak when doing a habit 7 days in a row. A power streak is earned when obtaining 3 regular streaks (meaning doing the habit for 21 days)
•	Choose your Habitar's egg - each egg will hatch a different creature!
•	Opt in for text message reminders - if you opt in, we will send you one text message a day to remind you to do the habit with the child. The reminder time is set under the "When is habit performed section"
•	Phone number - (optional) only needed if you want us to send you text message reminders
•	When is the habit performed? - (optional) only needed for the text message reminders. This tells us at what time you would like for us to send you the reminders
  3. On the Habitar page
•	Click the "completed today?" button if the habit was done for the day - every time you click the button, the child will earn a lightning bolt
•	After earning 7 lightning bolts the child will unlock their reward for completing a 7-day streak
•	After a 7-day streak, you can continue to keep track of habits to unlock a power streak, which unlocks the reward after completing the habit for 3 weeks!
